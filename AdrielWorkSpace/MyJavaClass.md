 | **Class Action:**        |  1. what does the class do under the hood, whats the program flow           |
 |  **Program Flow:**       |  2. what algorithms used ? , why choose this specific algorithms ?          |
 | **Testing Strategy:**    |  3. what are cases, edge cases, and whats my plan ?                         |
 | **Additional Info:**    |  4. whats the high level overview when I look or try to solve this program  | 
 |                          |  from different persepctive, what are the constraints / limitations ?       |

 Some other curious and strong questions to ask:
 What are the real constraints, how can I think and design the pseudocode as in abstract way as possible, what are possible challenges, how does my class relate to real world industry applications, whats my insights and whats the learning outcomes ?
 # TODO Virtual Library
 #ðŸ’¡Brain Storm PartðŸ’¡ 
 has user toggle on a checkbox GUI button, allow to get all the books How this works?
 the user will hover the mouse cursor into one book
 and they can hover to grab the books they want to read, [then all they need to do is throw them 
 into the checkout section  file in batches, but allow more flexibility in terms of control the 
 mouse cursor. 
 #Pseudocode from scratch 
 1. user open app 
 2. user interact with the GUI* 
 3. user create account
 4. user login
 5. user type in and it shows a list of books
 6. user check out
 7. can borrow only max 5 books 
 8. send a notification on the user screen to let them know they borrowed the books 

 **GUI might consists of CLI and UI** 
 focus more on the CLI and the core logic first possibly and then work on the UI mechanics
 should have a blank canvas for the user to enter and then a button [search], should display 
 search result, we can use a find button to replace with search,
