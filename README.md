# Group4
   [Group 4] We will be using a top down approach to design and implement a fully functional Virtual Library System and ready to test locally.
   
 # We are group 4
 * our team are working on designing a functional
   virtual library system. Our goal is to make sure it is correct, fast, and accurate
 # Team Project Structure: 
 * Our team ensure each and every member contribute equally, since we have 4 members, the tasks are involve and are expected to have 4
 * Java classes. 
 * Each class is well commented, and we ensure to include a header section which describes our team name and each contributor's name for
 * transparency. The project aims to make use, incoroporates data structures (arrays, linked lists, ... sorting algorithms) from what we 
 * learnt in class to apply to this project, as a whole group, we will design and enable least GUI components as possible.
 # Notes : 
 * We will include a more specific and detailed README file which briefly summarize our project aim, purposes, GUI functions and 
   and step by steps how to use the programs for you to test locally at any time.
 * .java source code MUST strictly upload to from each person to our group github repository
 *  Each individuals MUST  have a Github account and going to be add as a collaborator toward the group project
 *  At the end, must include a stand along .jar file uploaded and make sure it is working and excutable by no errors
 *  Each members, must cited the sources they use, whether from the internet, books, videos use  
 * Screen shots of the final result application should also include inside the repository
 # Code of Conducts: 
 * Treat people the way you want to be treated
 * Ensure active communication between other collaborators and works are expected to be on time 
 * Be professional and respect other contributors
 # Media Folder:
 * create a folder name media and attach multiple screenshots of the program run in real time
 * also include a .jar file
