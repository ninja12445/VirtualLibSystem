 Some more curious yet strong questions to ask:

 # TODO Virtual Library
 #ðŸ’¡Brain Storm PartðŸ’¡ 
 has user toggle on a checkbox GUI button, allow to get all the books How this works?
 the user will hover the mouse cursor into one book
 and they can hover to grab the books they want to read, [then all they need to do is throw them into the checkout section 
 file in batches, but allow more flexibility in terms of control the mouse cursor
