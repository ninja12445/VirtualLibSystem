Archieve Classes to push forward for 2nd phrase. 
Turn ideas into correctly working, functional, fast. 
Read textbook, w3school, tutorial points, geekforgeeks, java 8 document and referencing previous coding techniques for inspiration and stronger debug skill.

Debug technique discussion: 
I think Fail fast is the top, strongest, best , fastest , extremely amazing way to debug along with other tracing techniques, uncommented code, 
please do not guess coding as it is a form of gambling thought, you have to know what the code does what pass in and what yields return values

having a void method is only good for logging, however, I realize that how reliable return method are especially boolean, string, char, int 
directly flags, return what you want instantly. 

x is params, y is output [what returns] 
f(x) = y 

what i've learned when debugging so far
this.variableName = variableName;

the variableName is [this] from the private one, which assign local value into field using assignment operator

My suggestion is read documentation, you will learn so much. 
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/

Imagine you can create and replicate and implements your own methods and class referencing like this in Java. It is very intelligent 
for example: 
Math.sqrt(params)

Isn't it fascinating ? 
public class Fee {
    public static double sub (int months) {
        return months * MONTHLY_SUBSCRIPTION;
    }
}

Fee.sub(3);
